PURPOSE OF PROJECT:Was to complete a project using Java Gui (javax) to create a 10 x 10 board treasure game
VERSION or DATE: 12/15/2019
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
Start on the board if you want to change the conditions of the game.
AUTHORS: Howie Nguyen and Reese Johnson
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
As a user, I can see the title of game so that I know what I will be playing.
As a player, I can see a board of 10 by 10 locations where I can click, so that I can play the game.
As a player, when I click on a location it visually changes so I can see where I have already clicked.
As a player, when I click on a location that I have already clicked, nothing happens.
As a player, when I click on a location on the board, the Tries Left is reduced by one, so that I know how many tries I have left. I have 50 tries in a game.
As a player, I can see how many treasures that are hidden on the board, starting at 20, so that I know how far away from winning I am.
As a player, when I click on a location on the board, the appearance of the location changes so that I can see if there was a treasure randomly placed at the location.
As a player, when I click on a location on the board where there is a treasure, the Treasures Left is reduced by one, and the Treasures Found is increased by one , so that I can see how successful I have been so far.
As a player, when I click on a location, the Last Move field shows:
"Nothing" - if there was nothing at the location
"Treasure" - if there was a treasure at the location
"Game Over - You win" - if there are no treasures left
"Game Over - You lose" - if there are treasures more left but no tries
As a player, when I have no more tries left, clicking on the board locations does nothing.
As a player, when I have no more tries left, I can see where all the treasures are on the board.
